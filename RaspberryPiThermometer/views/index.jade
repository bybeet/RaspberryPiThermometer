	p Hitting any of the endpoints with a request that accepts JSON and not HTML will return the raw JSON data.
	h2 The Hardware
	p The system is running off a RaspberyPi. Currently all the electronics are on a, very messy, breadboard (future improvement would be a circuit board devoted to this project). The temperature sensor is annotated in the photo. The other electronics on the breadboard are an array of colored LEDs, an IR LED (for controlling the living room speakers via a web app), and an IR receiver (to get IR remote codes).
